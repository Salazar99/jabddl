## JABDDL
Just Another BDD Library

## Description
A simple library to create and view functions using bdds.

```bash
foo@bar:~$ mkdir build && cd build

foo@bar:~$ cmake ..
 
foo@bar:~$ make
```

## Usage 
The program will take an input.txt file formatted in the following way:


4-------------------------------//number of variables <br />
3-------------------------------//number of functions <br />
x1 x3 x4 x2---------------------//Variables names <br />
F1 = ite(x1, x2, 0)-------------//functions ... <br />
F2 = ite(x3, x4, 1)-------------//... <br />
F3 = ite(F2, F1+x1, F1-x1)------//... <br />
print(F3)-----------------------//prints of functions <br />
--------------------------------//... <br />

## Documentation
